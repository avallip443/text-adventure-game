## Game Overview

The Text-Based Adventure Game is an interactive dungeon exploration game where players progress through levels, encountering enemies and engaging in turn-based battles. The goal is to survive through each level, defeat enemies, and ultimately conquer the dungeon.

## Character Classes

Player can choose from the following character classes:

1. **Warrior:** A strong, tough, and well-rounded fighter.
2. **Rouge:** Quick and nimble, effective at landing critical attacks.
3. **Berserker:** Powerful and reckless, but lacks armour for defense.
4. **Brute:** Hard-to-kill, but packs a weak punch.

Each class has a unique stat for maximum hitpoints, attack strength, critical hit chance, and potion drop chance from slain enemies.

## How to Play

To run the game, download all the files and run AdventureGame.java in your terminal. 

Before the game begins, players will be prompted to selected a classes, represented by a number. Then, for each round, a randomly-generated number of enemies and enemies will appear for the player to battle. For each turn, the player can either attack, heal, or run away (although, there is a chance the enemy will block the last option). The game will run until either the player defeats all the enemies in the dungeon or dies trying.
